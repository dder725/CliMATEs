## Set up

## How to play
To play this game, press "New Game" on the start menu and you will be taken into the first world. The character moves around with either the arrow keys or WASD. The first objective will then be available in your 'Quest log' on the left. The Mum is the NPC closest to the player on spawn. 

## Objective clarifications
1. When talking to an NPC after pressing 't', you press 'Enter' to advance through the conversation. Making this more intuitive will be done in the next iteration
2. After talking to the saleperson and getting flower seeds, you need to remember to return to the Mum for the objective to complete
3. Press 'Space' to plant flowers. aking this more intuitive will be done in the next iteration
